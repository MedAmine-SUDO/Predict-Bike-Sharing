# Predict Bike Sharing

This is the first project in Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Project Overview

Build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership

The neural network was built from scratch using only numpy to assist, the goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network before diving deeper into other tools like TensorFlow.
